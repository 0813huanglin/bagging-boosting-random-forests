# Bagging, boosting and random forests
Bagging, boosting and random forests implemented in Matlab.

## Toolbox
The following toolbox is used:
- The Pattern Recognition toolbox (PRTools) made by 37steps : http://www.37steps.com/prtools/

## Scientific papers
These algorithms are based on the following research papers:
- Experiments with a new boosting algorithm: http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~leparker/Courses/CS425-528-fall10/Handouts/AdaBoost.M1.pdf
- Forest-RK: a new random forest induction method: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00436367/document
